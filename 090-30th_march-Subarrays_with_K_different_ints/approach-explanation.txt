Approach
This code implements a solution to find the number of subarrays in an array nums that contain exactly k distinct elements. Here's a brief explanation of the algorithm:

checkSubarrayAtmostK: This function calculates the number of subarrays with at most k distinct elements. It uses a sliding window approach with two pointers, i and j, to maintain a window of elements. It also uses an unordered map mpp to keep track of the count of each element within the current window.

i and j are initialized to 0.
Iterate through the array with the j pointer.
Increment the count of nums[j] in the map mpp.
While the number of distinct elements in the window (mpp.size()) is greater than k, move the i pointer forward and decrement the count of nums[i] in mpp. If the count becomes 0, remove nums[i] from mpp.
Update the count by adding the length of the current subarray (j - i) + 1.
Increment j to expand the window.
subarraysWithKDistinct: This function calculates the number of subarrays with exactly k distinct elements by subtracting the count of subarrays with at most k-1 distinct elements from the count of subarrays with at most k distinct elements.

Calls checkSubarrayAtmostK(nums, k) to get the count of subarrays with at most k distinct elements.
Calls checkSubarrayAtmostK(nums, k-1) to get the count of subarrays with at most k-1 distinct elements.
Returns the difference between the counts.
Overall, this algorithm efficiently finds the number of subarrays with exactly k distinct elements by leveraging the count of subarrays with at most k distinct elements and those with at most k-1 distinct elements.
