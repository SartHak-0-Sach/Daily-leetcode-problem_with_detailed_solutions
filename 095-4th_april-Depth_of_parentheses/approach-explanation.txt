Intuition
To find the nesting depth of the given VPS string s, we can iterate through each character of the string and keep track of the current nesting depth. Whenever we encounter an opening parenthesis '(', we increment the depth, and whenever we encounter a closing parenthesis ')', we decrement the depth. We update the maximum depth encountered so far accordingly.
Approach
1. Initialize variables count and max_num to keep track of the current depth and maximum depth encountered so far, respectively. Set both to 0.
2. Iterate through each character i in the input string s.
3. If i is '(', increment count by 1 and update max_num if count exceeds it.
4. If i is ')', decrement count by 1.
5. Finally, return max_num, which represents the maximum nesting depth.
Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n), where n is the length of the input string s. We traverse the entire string once.
Space complexity:
O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables count and max_num.
