Intuition
First thought that came in mind by seeing tree questions are bfs or dfs .Then as we have to checke a strictly increasing or decreasing order in levels so breadth first search would be a good approach to start .After that make an approach and implement it.

Approach
Here's the explanation of the code:

1-Breadth-First Search (BFS): The code uses BFS to traverse the tree level by level. It utilizes a queue to keep track of the nodes at each level.

2- Flag for Alternating Levels: It uses a boolean flag flag to determine whether the current level should have odd or even values.

3-Conditions Checking: Inside the BFS loop, the code checks the following conditions for each node:

4- If the current level is odd (flag is true), then the node value should be odd, and it should be strictly greater than the previous node's value.

5- If the current level is even (flag is false), then the node value should be even, and it should be strictly less than the previous node's value.

6- If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns false immediately.

7- Updating Queue: The code enqueues the left and right children of each node (if they exist) into the queue for the next level.

8- Updating Previous Value: The variable prev is updated with the value of the current node, ensuring it's used in the next iteration for comparison.

9- Alternating Levels: After processing each level, the flag is toggled to switch between odd and even levels.

10- Returning Result: If the BFS completes without encountering any violation of conditions, the function returns true, indicating that the tree is an Even-Odd Tree.

Complexity
Time complexity:0(n) because each node traversed once
Space complexity:0(n) because of queue
